Features I have built:

1. A surprise button
If a user press this button. I will randomly get four pokemons ids from a total list of 807
eg: [233, 454, 565, 23]
After this, I will call the pokemon API 4 times to get images of these 4 pokemons and shows on the screen. Each picture is clickable so users can click the picture to retrive details of a pokemon.

2. Search a Pokemon by name OR id
There is an input field on the screen, so if a user input a name or an id of a pokemon and press Search button. I will call the API once and get details of this certain pokemon.
I have also add a simple verification of the input field. If users click search button without input any names or ids. An error message would shows up.
